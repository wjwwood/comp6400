# Homework 2

## Description

The objective of homework 2 is to use the Translate, Scale, and Rotate transforms as well as the GL_SMOOTH mode.

## Building

To build my project you need the following Dependencies:

* gnu make
* cmake
* opengl
* glut or freeglut

If you have those dependencies then you can build by running:

   make

In the terminal in the root of my project directory.

Optionally you can run cmake manually by opening the cmake-gui and pointing the source directory to my homework folder, and then selecting a build directory.  Then you can click configure, select VS or unix makefile, finish the wizard, and then click generate.  Then you can close cmake-gui and build my project with VS or unix make (depending on the one you selected).

## Running

After building the project an executable called shelby(.exe) should be in the bin/ folder.  Execute it.
